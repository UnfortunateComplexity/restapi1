# restapi1
Attempt at creating a basic CRUD app (RESTful API). Covers user registration and login.

# How to get it working:
1. Start Apache and MySQL servers (recommended using a stack such as XAMPP).
2. Have an API client such as Postman.
3. Open a web browser, go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and import the database.
4. Start Postman, make a GET request to http://localhost/auth3/api/login.php or http://localhost/auth3/api/create_user.php to test the user login and creation respectively.

# Working so far:
* Create user with username, usertype and password.
* Login created user in the database with username and password.

# To be done:
* A lot tbh.
